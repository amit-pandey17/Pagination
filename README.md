# Pagination for displaying a few of the million records at a time

I have used the concept of pagination to handle a million records and display limited amount  at one time.
For this, I have use the React Bootstrap Table 2: https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/docs/getting-started.html. This has been used to enhance the looks of the table as it is populated with the data.

And for the Pagination, I have used: https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/docs/basic-pagination.html. 
This is an extension to React Bootstrap Table 2 called Paginator(Probably Doofenshmirtz from Phineas and Ferb made this).

For the data, I have used the data from Dummy API testing website called json placeholder using the photos data: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos.
